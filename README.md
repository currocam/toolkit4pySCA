The goal of toolkit4pySCA is to provide a bunch of useful functions in
order to obtain a sequence alignment using HMMER and associated
taxonomic information.Then, it allows to read the file generated by
pySCA and to analyze the results easily with R and tidyverse.

## Installation

You can install the development version of toolkit4pySCA from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("currocam/toolkit4pySCA")
```

## Example

This is a basic example showing how to carry out a typical workflow:

``` r
library(toolkit4pySCA)
library(Biostrings)
#> Loading required package: BiocGenerics
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'BiocGenerics'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     IQR, mad, sd, var, xtabs
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     anyDuplicated, append, as.data.frame, basename, cbind, colnames,
#>     dirname, do.call, duplicated, eval, evalq, Filter, Find, get, grep,
#>     grepl, intersect, is.unsorted, lapply, Map, mapply, match, mget,
#>     order, paste, pmax, pmax.int, pmin, pmin.int, Position, rank,
#>     rbind, Reduce, rownames, sapply, setdiff, sort, table, tapply,
#>     union, unique, unsplit, which.max, which.min
#> Loading required package: S4Vectors
#> Loading required package: stats4
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'S4Vectors'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     expand.grid, I, unname
#> Loading required package: IRanges
#> Loading required package: XVector
#> Loading required package: GenomeInfoDb
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'Biostrings'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     strsplit

# >2abl_A mol:protein length:163  ABL TYROSINE KINASE
example.seq <- AAString(
  paste0("MGPSENDPNLFVALYDFVASGDNTLSITKGEKLRVLGYNHNGEWCEAQTKNGQGWVPSNYITPVNSLE",
  "KHSWYHGPVSRNAAEYLLSSGINGSFLVRESESSPGQRSISLRYEGRVYHYRINTASDGKLYVSSESRFNTLAELV",
  "HHHSTVADGLITTLHYPAP")
  )
xml.document <- quick_AA_search_using_phmmer(example.seq)
class(xml.document)
#> [1] "externalptr"
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
